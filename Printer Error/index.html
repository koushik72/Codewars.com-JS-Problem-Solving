        /*In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

        The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, then one time color a...

        Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm.

        You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will output the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

        The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

        Examples:

        s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
        error_printer(s) => "0/14"

        s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
        error_printer(s) => "8/22"*/

        function printerError(s) {
            // your code
            var afterM = /[n-z]/gi;
            var x, y = s.length;
            if (afterM.test(s)) {
                x = s.match(afterM).length;
            } else {
                x = 0;
            }
            return x + "/" + y;
        }

        console.log(printerError('abcdnopqrst'));

        console.log(printerError('aaabbbbhaijjjm'));
        console.log(printerError('aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm'));
